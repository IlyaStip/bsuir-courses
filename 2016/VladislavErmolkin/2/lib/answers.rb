Honestly, I don't feel enthusiastic about doing smth.
But I'm just a bot and have no choise.
So it's list of tasks I can take:

/start - displays a greeting and a description of all available commands
/semester - remembers the beginning and end of the semester dates
/subject - adds subject and number of labs of it
/status - displays your list of labs you have to pass
/reset - clears all the user data
/submit or \"I passed.\" - remembers which lab you passed".freeze
